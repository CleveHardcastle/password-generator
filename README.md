# password-generator:

Description:

This is a password generator that will take a value of numbers, prompts for lower, upper, numbers, and special characters and will spit out a value on the screen that is the total of all the prompts.

Instalation:

No special tools needed, just a web browser.

Special Thanks:

A big thanks goes out to Sam, without her help and the ability to bounce the questions in my head off her it would have taken me much, much longer to get this done.
